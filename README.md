# Web102 Weekly Labs

## Overview
This folder contains my weekly lab projects for CodePath’s WEB102 course, where I’m learning web development. Each lab is a standalone project designed to build skills in coding, problem-solving, and front-end design and back-end later in the course. The first lab, "timetabled," kicks off the series with a React-based calendar tracking Ted Bundy’s final week.

## Structure
- **timetabled/**: First lab—a React app visualizing Ted Bundy’s last week of freedom in 1978.
- Additional labs will be added as I progress through the WEB102 course.

## Purpose
These labs are my hands-on journey into web development, exploring tools like React, Vite, JSX, and CSS while completing practical assignments for WEB102.

## Setup
- Each lab has its own README with specific instructions.
- General steps:
  - Clone the repo: 
  - Navigate to a lab folder (e.g., `cd timetabled`)
  - Install: `npm install`
  - Run: `npm run dev`

## Acknowledgments
- Part of CodePath’s WEB102 course.
